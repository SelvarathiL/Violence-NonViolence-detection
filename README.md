### VIOLENCE–NONVIOLENCE DETECTION

##ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project aims to classify video scenes as VIOLENCE or NON-VIOLENCE using Deep Learning.
Two models were used — a pretrained MobileNet and a custom-built ResNet-18 — to detect violent actions in frames extracted from videos.

The project demonstrates how deep learning architectures can be applied for scene understanding and human behavior recognition in real-world conditions.
